- Overview of matches to restream
- Admin: add custom match results (without racetime)
- When recording, download races from racetime and suggest matches to record
- Combine restreamChannel and restreamer into one object in Match
- Allow adding matches with a json with just id (don't need to know pair seeds etc)

Checks
- Check todos
- Remove extra logs
- Check what is displayed in case of error / no data
- Check Query settings, like staletime
- Check everything on smaller screen / mobile

Nice to have
- Alert bar when there is a match to record
- Replace BorderRadius with variable
